## Research and Planning

### User Personas

+ What is it and why is it important?
  + Sets of characteristics that form a specific person
  + Represents a significant portion of users
  + Enables designer to focus on manageable and important cast of users
    + Example: A classroom of students will have varying needs/wants amongst them
  + Empathy for the user allowing for deeper understand of needs
  + Provides point of reference for success/failure

### Objective

+ Apply research insights
+ Design product that eases stress and simplifies the issue at hand

## Sketching 

### Wireframes Best Practices

+ Use common UX patterns
  * For example: search bar on top
+ Focus on the task at hand
+ Delay the hard parts
  * For example: make the user sign up for the service as late into the process as possible
+ Help users make decision

### Visual Design Best Practices

+ Be tasteful and exercise restraint
+ Product consistency
+ Speak directly
  * For example: good error messages ("Error 0x0123" vs. "Error in connection, please restart the system")
+ Clear navigation
+ Good, clean, and easy to read font
+ Consistent design
+ Good contrast between font and background
+ Balance between whitespace and content

## Prototyping

+ What do we use prototypes for?
  * Client buy-in
  * Team collaboration
  * User research and validation

+ InVision
  * Helps create a "working" prototype from images for the design
  * Get feedback on UX from designers and research participants
  * Don't need to actually develop a full fledged app
  * Easy to modify designs from user feedback
